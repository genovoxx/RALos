The open source, open access software stack for regenerative agriculture needs

RALos - operating system for the regenerative agriculture
To force the transformation of agriculture into regenerative forms - which saves the planet by carbon farming and restoration of biodiversity - we aim to build, 
based on a common digital language (RAL - regenerative agriculture language), a open access software layer that supports the needs of small and medium regenerative farms, 
supporting science projects and startup companies to build tools from fork to table. Join this revolution!
